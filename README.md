# Mini Projects Collection – Machine Learning, Computer Vision & Data Analysis

This repository contains a curated collection of small but high-quality ML, CV, and Data Analysis projects.  
Each project focuses on one specific learning task and includes a clean notebook, detailed analysis, and reproducible code.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate a broad skill set across different machine learning domains:
- Traditional ML classification & regression  
- Deep learning with TensorFlow  
- Computer vision with YOLOv8  
- Clustering & unsupervised learning  
- EDA with statistical visualization
