# HeartDisease-FCN

## Overview

The **HeartDisease-FCN** notebook demonstrates the use of a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for multiclass classification of heart disease data. The model is designed to predict various classes of heart disease based on features provided in the dataset.

### Key Features:
- **FCN Deep Learning Model**: Used for multiclass classification to predict different types of heart disease.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes depth analysis of the dataset, visualized through various charts like **Violin Plots** and **Histograms** to understand the distribution of features.
  
## Dataset
This project uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains several attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, etc., that are used to predict heart disease.

## Libraries and Dependencies
- TensorFlow (for building and training the FCN model)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
- scikit-learn (for preprocessing and evaluation)
